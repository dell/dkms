.SH NAME
dkms \- Dynamic Kernel Module Support
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY dkms
.OP action
.OP options
.OP module/module-version
.OP /path/to/source-tree
.OP /path/to/tarball.tar
.OP /path/to/driver.rpm
.YS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dkms
is a framework which allows kernel modules to be dynamically built
for each kernel on your system in a simplified and organized fashion.
.SH ACTIONS
.SY add
.OP "module/module\-version | /path/to/source\-tree | /path/to/tarball.tar"
.YS
.IP "" 4
Adds a module/module\-version combination to the tree for builds and installs.
If
.IR module/module\-version ,
.IR "\-m module/module\-version" ,
or
.I \-m module\ \-v module\-version
are passed as options, this command
requires source in
.I /usr/src/<module>\-<module\-version>/
as well as a properly
formatted
.I dkms.conf
file. If
.I /path/to/source\-tree
is passed as an option, and source-tree contains a
.I dkms.conf
file, it will copy
.I /path/to/source\-tree
to
.IR /usr/src/module\-module\-version .
If
.I /path/to/tarball.tar
is passed, this command behaves like the
.B ldtarball
command.
.SY remove
.OP module/module\-version
.OP -k kernel/arch
.OP \-\-all
.YS
.IP "" 4
Removes a module/version or module/version/kernel/arch combination from the
tree. If the module is currently installed, it first uninstalls it
and if applicable, will replace it with its original_module. Use the
.B \-\-all
option in order to remove all instances for every kernel at once.
.SY build
.OP module/module\-version
.OP -k kernel/arch
.OP --force
.YS
.IP "" 4
Builds the specified module/version combo for the specified kernel/arch. If
the
.I \-k
option is not specified it builds for the currently running kernel and arch. All builds
occur in the directory
.I /var/lib/dkms/<module>/<module\-version>/build/.
If the module/module\-version combo has not been added, dkms will try to add it, and in that
case
.B build
can take the same arguments that
.B add
can.
If the module is already built, it will not be rebuilt again by default, and the
.B --force
option should be used to override this.
.SY unbuild
.OP module/module\-version
.OP -k kernel/arch
.OP \-\-all
.YS
.IP "" 4
Undoes the build for a module/version or module/version/kernel/arch combination from the
tree. If the module is currently installed, it first uninstalls it
and if applicable, will replace it with its original_module. Finally all binary
kernel modules are removed. Use the
.B \-\-all
option in order to remove all instances for every kernel at once.
.SY install
.OP module/module\-version
.OP -k kernel/arch
.OP --force
.OP /path/to/driver.rpm
.YS
.IP "" 4
Installs a built module/version combo onto the kernel it was built for. If
the kernel option is not specified it assumes the currently running kernel.
If the module has not been built, dkms will try to build it.
If the module has not been added, dkms will try to add it. In both cases, the
.B install
command can then take the same arguments as the
.B build
or
.B add
commands.
If the module is already installed, it will not be reinstalled again
by default, and the
.B --force
option should be used to override this.
If you pass a .rpm file, dkms will try to install that file with
.BR "rpm -Uvh" ,
and it will perform an
.B autoinstall
action to be sure that everything is built for your kernel if the RPM installed successfully.
.SY uninstall
.OP module/module\-version
.OP -k kernel/arch
.OP \-\-all
.YS
.IP "" 4
Uninstalls an installed module/module\-version combo from the kernel/arch passed in the -k option, or the
current kernel if the -k option was not passed. Use the
.B \-\-all
option in order to uninstall all instances for every kernel at once.
After uninstall completion, the driver will be left in the built state.
To completely remove a driver, the remove action should be utilized.
.SY match
.OP --templatekernel kernel/arch
.OP -k kernel/arch
.YS
.IP "" 4
Match installs modules onto the specified kernel by looking at the
configuration of the specified
.B templatekernel.
Every module that is installed on the
.B templatekernel
within
.B dkms
is then installed on that specified kernel.
.SY mktarball
.OP module/module\-version
.OP -k kernel/arch
.OP --archive /path/to/tarball.tar
.OP --source-only
.OP --binaries-only
.YS
.IP "" 4
Creates a tarball archive for the specified module/version of all files
in the DKMS tree for that module/version combination. This includes
the source and any built modules for kernels in the tree (as specified).
Otherwise, you can specify
a singular kernel to archive only, or multiple kernels to archive
(\-k kernel1/arch1 \-k kernel2/arch2). Optionally, you can use
.B \-\-archive
to specify the file that you would like to save this
tarball to. You can also specify
.B \-\-binaries\-only
if you want the resultant tarball not to include the module source. Likewise,
.B \-\-source-only
can be used to specify that no prebuilt binaries should be included in the tarball.
In general,
.B mktarball
is great for systems management purposes as you can build your driver
on just one system and then use
.B ldtarball
on all of your other systems to get the same built modules loaded
without having to wait for anything to compile.
.SY ldtarball
.OP /path/to/tarball.tar
.OP --force
.YS
.IP "" 4
This takes a tarball made from the
.B mktarball
command and loads it into your DKMS tree. This will leave any
newly added modules in the built state and
.B dkms install
should then be called to install any of them. If files already
exist where
.B ldtarball
is attempting to place them, it will warn and not copy over them. The
.B \-\-force
option should be used to override this.
.SY status
.OP module/module\-version
.OP -k kernel/arch
.YS
.IP "" 4
Returns the current status of modules, versions and kernels within
the tree as well as whether they have been added, built or installed.
Status can be shown for just a certain module, a certain kernel,
a module/version combination or a module/version/kernel combination.

If the source directory, or the symbolic link 'source' pointing to it is missing,
the status of the module/version combination will be displayed as 'broken'.
In that case dkms will not perform any other action on that particular module/version combination.
Manual intervention is required.
If only the symbolic link 'source' is missing, the
.B add
action may be used to re-add the module/version combination to dkms.
.SY autoinstall
.YS
.IP "" 4
Attempt to install the latest revision of all modules that have been installed for other kernel revisions.
dkms_autoinstaller is a stub that uses this action to perform its work.
.SY generate_mok
.YS
.IP "" 4
Command to be issued standalone to generate Secure Boot keys. Required only if prior manipulation of the keys is needed,
otherwise the keys are automatically generated on the first build attempt of a DKMS module.

No additional arguments are parsed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-m <module>/<module\-version>
The name of the module and module version you want to operate on. The
.B \-m
part of this option is optional, and can be omitted in virtually all circumstances.
.TP
.B \-v <module\-version>
The version of the module to execute the specified action upon. This option only has to be specified
if you pass a
.B \-m
option without a <module\-version> component of its own.
.TP
.B \-k <kernel\-version>/<arch>
The kernel and arch to perform the action upon. You can specify multiple kernel version/arch pairs
on the command line by repeating the \-k argument with a different kernel version and arch.
However, not all actions support multiple kernel versions (it will error out
in this case).
The arch part can be omitted, and DKMS will assume you want it to be the arch of the currently running
system.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-arch
The system architecture to perform the action upon. It is optional if you pass it as part of the
.B \-k
option. If not specified, it assumes
the arch of the currently running system (`uname \-m`). You can specify multiple
arch parameters on the same command line by repeating the \-a argument with a
different arch name. When multiple architectures are specified, there must
be a 1:1 relationship between \-k arguments to \-a arguments. DKMS will then
assume the first \-a argument aligns with the first \-k kernel and so on for the
second, third, etc.

For example, if you were to specify: \-k kernel1 \-k kernel2 \-a i386 \-k kernel3 \-a i686 \-a x86_64,
DKMS would process this as: kernel1-i386, kernel2-i686, kernel3-x86_64.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Quiet.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Prints the currently installed version of dkms and exits.
.TP
.B \-c <dkms.conf\-location>
The location of the
.I dkms.conf
file. This is needed for the add action and if not specified,
it is assumed to be located in
.I /usr/src/<module>\-<module\-version>/.
See below for more information on the format of
.I dkms.conf.
.TP
.B \-\-config <kernel\-.config\-location>
During a
.B build
this option is used to specify an alternate location for the kernel .config
file which was used to compile that kernel. Normally,
.B dkms
uses the Red Hat standard location and config filenames located in
.I /usr/src/linux\-<kernel>/configs/.
If the config for the kernel that you
are building a module for is not located here or does not have the expected
name in this location, you will need to tell
.B dkms
where the necessary .config can be found so that your kernel can be properly
prepared for the module build.
.TP
.B \-\-archive <tarball\-location>
This option is used during a
.B ldtarball
action to specify the location of the tarball you wish to load into
your DKMS tree. You only have to specify the
.B --archive
part of this option if <tarball\-location> does not already exist as a file.
.TP
.B \-\-templatekernel <kernel\-version>
This option is required for the action:
.B match.
Match will look at the
templatekernel specified and install all of the same module/version
combinations on the other kernel.
.TP
.B \-\-force
This option can be used in conjunction with
.B build, install 
and 
.B ldtarball
to force copying over existing files.
.TP
.B \-\-force\-version\-override
This option skips the checks whether the version of the module, which is
going to be installed, is newer than the already installed version.
.TP
.B \-\-binaries\-only
This option can be used in conjunction with
.B mktarball
in order to create a DKMS tarball which does not contain the source for the
module within it. This can be helpful in reducing the size of the tarball
if you know that the system which this tarball will be loaded upon already
has the source installed. In order to load a tarball made as binaries-only
.B you must
have the module source in that systems DKMS tree. If you do not, DKMS
.B will refuse
to load a binaries-only tarball.
.TP
.B \-\-source\-only
This option can be used in conjunction with
.B mktarball
but do not want the tarball you create to have any prebuilt modules within it,
passing this option will keep its internal DKMS tarball from containing any
prebuilt modules.
.TP
.B \-\-all
This option can be used to automatically specify all relevant kernels/arches
for a module/module-version. This can be used for things like remove, unbuild
and uninstall. This saves the trouble of having to actually specify \-k kernel1 \-a
arch1 \-k kernel2 \-a arch2 for every kernel you have built your module for.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-depmod
This option prevents DKMS from running the depmod command during
.B install
and
.B uninstall
which will avoid (re)calculating module dependencies and thereby save time.
.TP
.B \-\-modprobe\-on\-install
This option executes modprobe on the modules upon successful installation.
.TP
.B \-\-kernelsourcedir <kernel\-source\-directory\-location>
Using this option you can specify the location of your kernel source
directory. Most likely you will not need to set this if your kernel
source is accessible via
.I @MODDIR@/$kernel_version/build.
.TP
.B \-\-directive <"cli\-directive=cli\-value">
Using this option, you can specify additional directives from the command
line. The
.B \-\-directive
option can be used multiple times on the same command-line to specify
multiple additional command line directives.
.TP
.B \-\-rpm_safe_upgrade
This flag should be used when packaging DKMS enabled modules in RPMs. It should
be specified during both the
.B add
and
.B remove
actions in the RPM spec to ensure that DKMS and RPM behave correctly in all
scenarios when upgrading between various versions of a dkms enabled module
RPM package.
.TP
.B \-\-dkmstree path/to/place
Provides a destination tree for building and installing modules to. Useful in
cases that you don't want to contaminate a system when using solely for building.
.TP
.B \-\-sourcetree path/to/place
Provides a location to build a DKMS package from. Useful for systems that you may
not have root access, but would still like to be able to build DKMS packages.
.TP
.B \-\-installtree path/to/place
Provides a location to place modules when a
.I dkms install
command is issued.
.TP
.B \-j number
Run no more than
.I number
jobs in parallel; see the -j option of
.I make(1).
Defaults to the number of CPUs in the system, detected by
.I nproc(1).
Specify 0 to impose no limit on the number of parallel jobs.
.TP
.B \-\-verbose
Enable verbose output of external commands executed in DKMS.
.SH ORIGINAL MODULES
During the first install of a module for a <kernelversion>,
.B dkms
will search
.I @MODDIR@/<kernelversion>
for a pre-existing module of the same name. If one is found, it will automatically
be saved as an "original_module" so that if the newer module is later removed,
.B dkms
will put the original module back in its place. Currently, DKMS searches
for these original modules with first preference going to modules located in
.I @MODDIR@/<kernelversion>/updates/
followed by
.B $DEST_MODULE_LOCATION
(as specified in
.I dkms.conf
). If one cannot be found in either location, a find will be used to locate one for
that kernel.
If none are found, then during a later uninstall, your kernel will not have that module
replaced.

If more than one is found, then the first one located (by preference indicated
above) will be considered the "original_module". As well, all copies of the same-named
module will be removed from your kernel tree and placed into
.I /var/lib/dkms/<module>/original_module/$kernelver/collisions
so that they can be *manually* accessible later. DKMS will never actually do anything
with the modules found underneath the /collisions directory, and they will be stored there
until you manually delete them.
.SH DKMS.CONF
When performing an
.BR add ,
a proper
.I dkms.conf
file must be found. A properly formatted conf file is essential
for communicating to
.B dkms
how and where the module should be installed. While not all the directives
are required, providing as many as possible helps to limit any ambiguity. Note
that the
.I dkms.conf
is really only a shell\-script of variable definitions which are then sourced in
by the
.B dkms
executable (of the format, DIRECTIVE="directive text goes here"). As well, the
directives are case\-sensitive and should be given in
.B ALL CAPS.

It is important to understand that many of the DKMS directives are arrays whose index
values are tied together. These array associations can be considered families, and there
are currently three such families of directive arrays. MAKE[#] and MAKE_MATCH[#] make up
one family. PATCH[#] and PATCH_MATCH[#] make up the second family. The third and
largest family consists of BUILT_MODULE_NAME[#], BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION[#], DEST_MODULE_NAME[#],
DEST_MODULE_LOCATION[#] and STRIP[#]. When indexing these arrays when creating your
dkms.conf, each family should start at index value 0.
.TP
.B PACKAGE_NAME=
This directive is used to give the name associated with the entire package of modules. This is the same
name that is used with the
.B \-m
option when building, adding, etc. and may not necessarily be the same as the MODULE_NAME. This
directive must be present in every dkms.conf.
.TP
.B PACKAGE_VERSION=
This directive is used to give the version associated with the entire package of modules being installed within that dkms
package. This directive must be present in every dkms.conf.
.TP
.B BUILT_MODULE_NAME[#]=
This directive gives the name of the module just after it is built. If your DKMS module
package contains more than one module to install, this is a
.B required
directive for all of the modules. This directive should explicitly not contain any
trailing ".o" or ".ko".
Note that for each module within a dkms package, the numeric value of
.B #
must be the same for each of BUILT_MODULE_NAME, BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION, DEST_MODULE_NAME and
DEST_MODULE_LOCATION and that the numbering should start at 0 (eg. BUILT_MODULE_NAME[0]="qla2200"
BUILT_MODULE_NAME[1]="qla2300").
.TP
.B BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION[#]=
This directive tells DKMS where to find your built module after it has been built. This
pathname should be given relative to the root directory of your source files (where your
dkms.conf file can be found). If unset, DKMS expects to find your
.B BUILT_MODULE_NAME[#]
in the root directory of your source files.
Note that for each module within a dkms package, the numeric value of
.B #
must be the same for each of BUILT_MODULE_NAME, BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION, DEST_MODULE_NAME and
DEST_MODULE_LOCATION and that the numbering should start at 0 (eg. BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION[0]="some/dir/"
BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION[1]="other/dir/").
.TP
.B DEST_MODULE_NAME[#]=
This directive can be used to specify the name of the module as it should be installed. This
will rename the module from
.B BUILT_MODULE_NAME[#]
to
.B DEST_MODULE_NAME[#].
This directive should explicitly not contain any trailing ".o" or ".ko". If unset, it is
assumed to be the same value as
.B BUILT_MODULE_NAME[#].
Note that for each module within a dkms package, the numeric value of
.B #
must be the same for each of BUILT_MODULE_NAME, BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION, DEST_MODULE_NAME and
DEST_MODULE_LOCATION and that the numbering should start at 0 (eg. DEST_MODULE_NAME[0]="qla2200_6x"
DEST_MODULE_NAME[1]="qla2300_6x").
.TP
.B DEST_MODULE_LOCATION[#]=
This directive specifies the destination where a module should be installed to, once compiled. It also
is used for finding original_modules. This is a
.B required
directive, except as noted below. This directive must start with the text "/kernel" which is in reference to
@MODDIR@/<kernelversion>/kernel.
Note that for each module within a dkms package, the numeric value of
.B #
must be the same for each of BUILT_MODULE_NAME, BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION, DEST_MODULE_NAME and
DEST_MODULE_LOCATION and that the numbering should start at 0 (eg. DEST_MODULE_LOCATION[0]="/kernel/drivers/something/"
DEST_MODULE_LOCATION[1]="/kernel/drivers/other/").

DEST_MODULE_LOCATION is ignored on Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Novell SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10
and higher, Novell SuSE Linux 10.0 and higher, and Ubuntu. Instead, the proper distribution-specific directory is used.
.TP
.B STRIP[#]=
By default strip is considered to be "yes". If set to "no", DKMS will not
run strip \-g against your built module to remove debug symbols from it.
STRIP[0] is used as the default for any unset entries in the STRIP array.
.TP
.B MAKE[#]=
The MAKE directive array tells DKMS which make command should be used for building your module. The default make command
should be put into
.B MAKE[0].
Other entries in the MAKE array will only be used if their corresponding entry in
.B MAKE_MATCH[#]
matches, as a regular expression (using grep -E), the kernel that the module is being built for.
Note that if no value is placed in
.B MAKE_MATCH[#]
for any
.B MAKE[#]
where # > 0, then that
.B MAKE
directive is ignored.
.B MAKE_MATCH[0]
is optional and if it is populated, it will be used to determine
if MAKE[0] should be used to build the module for that kernel. If multiple
.B MAKE_MATCH
directives match against the kernel being built for, the last matching
.B MAKE[#]
will be used to build your module. If no MAKE directive is specified or if no
MAKE_MATCH matches the kernel being built for, DKMS
will attempt to use a generic MAKE command to build your module.

KERNELRELEASE will be automatically appended to MAKE[#]. If you want to
suppress this behavior, you can quote the make command: 'make'.
.TP
.B MAKE_MATCH[#]=
See the above entry on
.B MAKE[#]
directives. This array should be populated with regular expressions which, when matched
against the kernel being built for, will tell
.B DKMS
to use the corresponding make command in the
.B MAKE[#]
directive array to build your module.
.TP
.B CLEAN=
CLEAN specifies the make clean command to be used to clean up both before and after building the
module. If unset, it is assumed to be "make clean".
.TP
.B NO_WEAK_MODULES=
The
.B NO_WEAK_MODULES
parameter prevents dkms from creating a symlink into the weak-updates directory, which is the
default on Red Hat derivatives. The weak modules facility was designed to eliminate the need to
rebuild kernel modules when kernel upgrades occur and relies on the symbols within the kABI.

Fedora does not guaranteed a stable kABI so it should be disabled in the specific module override by setting it to "yes". For example, for an Nvidia DKMS module you would set the following in /etc/dkms/nvidia.conf:

NO_WEAK_MODULES="yes"
.TP
.B OBSOLETE_BY=
This directive allows you to specify a kernel version that obsoletes the necessity for this
particular DKMS module. This can be specified as a particular upstream kernel or an ABI
bump of a kernel. For example, "2.6.24" would be an upstream kernel and "2.6.24\-16" would
represent an ABI bump for a kernel. Both are valid in this area.

Please avoid the use of
.B OBSOLETE_BY
wherever possible. It's use indicates a lack of proper module
versioning using
.B MODULE_VERSION()
tags in the module source itself. It is better to fix the
.B MODULE_VERSION()
tags than use
.B OBSOLETE_BY.
This also introduces a implicit distribution/version dependency on the
package, as the value of
.B OBSOLETE_BY
is meaningful only in the context of a single distribution/version.
.TP
.B PATCH[#]=
Use the PATCH directive array to specify patches which should be applied to your source before a build occurs.
All patches are expected to be in \-p1 format and are applied with the patch \-p1 command.
Each directive should specify the filename of the patch to apply, and all patches must
be located in the patches subdirectory of your source directory (
.I /usr/src/<module>\-<module\-version>/patches/
). If any patch fails to apply, the build will be halted and the rejections can be
inspected in
.I /var/lib/dkms/<module>/<module\-version>/build/.
If a PATCH should only be applied conditionally, the
.B PATCH_MATCH[#]
array should be used, and a corresponding regular expression should be placed in
.B PATCH_MATCH[#]
which will alert dkms to only use that
.B PATCH[#]
if the regular expression matches the kernel which the module is currently being built for.
.TP
.B PATCH_MATCH[#]=
See the above description for
.B PATCH[#]
directives. If you only want a patch applied in certain scenarios, the
.B PATCH_MATCH
array should be utilized by giving a regular expression which matches
the kernels you intend the corresponding
.B PATCH[#]
to be applied to before building that module.
.TP
.B AUTOINSTALL=
If this directive is set to
.B yes
then the service
.I /etc/rc.d/init.d/dkms_autoinstaller
will automatically try to install this module on any kernel you boot into. See the section
on
.B dkms_autoinstaller
for more information.
.TP
.B BUILD_DEPENDS[#]=
This optional directive is an array that allows you to specify other modules as
dependencies for your module. Each array element should be the
.B PACKAGE_NAME
of another module that is managed by dkms. Do not specify a version or
architecture in the dependency. Note that this directive is only advisory;
missing or broken dependencies cause non-fatal warnings.
.TP
.B BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL=
This optional directive allows you to specify a regular expression which defines
the subset of kernels which DKMS is allowed to build your module for.
If the kernel being built for does not match against this regular expression (or
does not the satisfy the constraints of any other
.B BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_*
directive), the dkms build will error out with exit code 77.
Note that dkms autoinstall will ignore this type of error condition and simply
skip the respective modules.
For example, if you set it as ="^2\.4.*", your module would not be built for 2.6
or later kernels.
.TP
.B BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL_MIN=
and
.B BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL_MAX=
These optional directives allow one to specify the minimal and maximal kernel
versions supported by the module. If one (or both) of these are defined, the
module will not be built for kernels outside the specified version limits.
For example, if you set
.B BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL_MIN
as "=3.5", your module would be built for e.g. "3.5-rc2", "3.6.18" or other
later versions but not for "3.4.999" or earlier kernels.
Similarly, if you set
.B BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL_MAX
as ="4.12", your module would be built for e.g. "4.11.999", "3.9-rc5" or
other earlier versions, but not for "4.12-rc1" or later kernels.
.TP
.B BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_ARCH=
This optional directive functions very similarly to
.B BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL
except that it matches against the kernel architecture. For example, if you set
it to ="i.86", your module would not be built for ia32e, x86_64, amd64, s390, etc.
.TP
.B BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_CONFIG=
This optional directive allows you to specify a space separated list of
kernel configuration options ("CONFIG_FOO") that must be enabled in the
targeted kernels ".config" file (either to be compiled in or to be built
as a module) or absent (if prefixed with an exclamation mark, e.g.
"!CONFIG_BAR") in order to build the module.
For example, if you set it as ="CONFIG_PCI !CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT", your module
would only be built for kernels that have PCI enabled, but the RT patchset
disabled.
.TP
.B POST_ADD=
The name of the script to be run after an
.B add
is performed. The path should be given relative to the root directory of your source.
.TP
.B POST_BUILD=
The name of the script to be run after a
.B build
is performed. The path should be given relative to the root directory of your source.
.TP
.B POST_INSTALL=
The name of the script to be run after an
.B install
is performed. The path should be given relative to the root directory of your source.
.TP
.B POST_REMOVE=
The name of the script to be run after a
.B remove
is performed. The path should be given relative to the root directory of your source.
.TP
.B PRE_BUILD=
The name of the script to be run before a
.B build
is performed. The path should be given relative to the root directory of your source.
.TP
.B PRE_INSTALL=
The name of the script to be run before an
.B install
is performed. The path should be given relative to the root directory
of your source. If the script exits with a non\-zero value, the
install will be aborted. This is typically used to perform a custom
version comparison.
.TP
.SH DKMS.CONF VARIABLES
Within your
.I dkms.conf
file, you can use certain variables which will be replaced at run\-time with their
values.
.TP
.B $kernelver
This variable can be used within a directive definition and during use, the actual kernel
version in question will be substituted in its place. This is especially useful in MAKE
commands when specifying which INCLUDE statements should be used when compiling your
module (eg. MAKE="make all INCLUDEDIR=@MODDIR@/${kernelver}/build/include").
.TP
.B $kernel_source_dir
This variable holds the value of the location of your kernel source directory. Usually, this
will be
.IR @MODDIR@/$kernelver/build ,
unless otherwise specified with the
.B \-\-kernelsourcedir
option.
.SH DKMS.CONF OVERRIDES
You can override the module-provided
.I dkms.conf
files. Every time after a dkms.conf file is read, dkms will look for and read the following files in order:
.PP
.I /etc/dkms/<module>.conf
.br
.I /etc/dkms/<module>\-<module\-version>.conf
.br
.I /etc/dkms/<module>\-<module\-version>\-<kernel>.conf
.br
.I /etc/dkms/<module>\-<module\-version>\-<kernel>\-<arch>.conf
.PP
You can use these files to override settings in the module-provided dkms.conf files.
.SH /etc/dkms/framework.conf
This configuration file controls how the overall DKMS framework handles. It is sourced
in every time the dkms command is run. Mainly it can currently be used to set different
default values for the variables.

The file contains descriptions for each directive it supports.

Additionally to /etc/dkms/framework.conf,
.B any file matching the glob
/etc/dkms/framework.conf.d/*.conf will be loaded as well.
.TP
.B $dkms_tree, $source_tree, $install_tree, $tmp_location
Control which folders DKMS uses for components and artifacts.
.TP
.B $verbose
Can be set to anything but a null value to enable verbose output of external commands executed in DKMS.
.TP
.B $symlink_modules
Controls whether binary modules are copied to @MODDIR@ or if only symlinks are created there. Note that these variables can also
be manipulated on the command line with \-\-dkmstree, \-\-sourcetree, \-\-installtree
and \-\-symlink-modules options.
.TP
.B $autoinstall_all_kernels
Used by the common postinst for DKMS modules. It controls if the build should be done for all installed kernels or only for the current and latest installed kernel. It has no command
line equivalent.
.TP
.B $sign_file
This is the path of the
.I sign-file
kernel binary that is used to sign the kernel modules. The variable
.B $kernelver
can be used in path to represent the target kernel version. The path for the binary depends on the distribution.
.TP
.B $mok_signing_key, $mok_certificate
Location of the key and certificate files used for Secure boot. The variable
.B $kernelver
can be used in path to represent the target kernel version.

NOTE: If any of the files specified by $mok_signing_key and
$mok_certificate are non-existant, dkms will re-create both files.

.I mok_signing_key
can also be a "pkcs11:..." string for PKCS#11 engine, as long as the sign_file program supports it.
.TP
.B $modprobe_on_install
Automatically load the built modules upon successful installation.
.TP
.B $parallel_jobs
Run no more than this number of jobs in parallel.
.SH dkms_autoinstaller
This boot\-time service automatically installs any module which has
.B AUTOINSTALL="yes"
set in its
.B dkms.conf
file. The service works quite simply and if multiple versions of a module are in
your system's DKMS tree, it will not do anything and instead explain that manual
intervention is required.
